# 1. INTRODUCTION 
    In this assignment , I developed four applications in Python and C#. I developed a file extension information system and a contact book in C#. I wrote a hotel web-scraping application in Python which writes information to CSV file and a client-server application in Python to record student admission. These tasks helped me to practice programming, working with data, and solve real-life problems. 
 
# 2. PART I: C# PROGRAMMING 
  #  2.1 Contact Book 
   In this assignment, I developed a C# contact book program . This project consisted of two files :  
a)	Program.cs for the main menu and all functions. 
b)	ContactBook.cs for the ContactBook class. 
 I created a ContactBook class with a name, company , phone , email and birthdate of each contact . The program starts  with 20 contacts in an array . The menu lets the user to add , view , update , or delete a contact , also it checks that the phone number is 9 digits. I used basic OOP concepts and tested the program using dotnet run , which keeps going until the user exits . 

 
 # 2.2  File Extension System 
 In response to this question, I created a C# console application that displays the information about 
different file extensions. In this project . 
         I was working with two files : 
a)	Program. cs – The menu and all functions are contained here. 
b)	FileExtension. cs – The class contains the FileExtension . 
 
     FileExtension class contains two aspects: 
a)	The file extension (like .mp4,.pdf)    
b)	Its description (like video file, document , audio file) 
 
 I did a program where 20 default file extensions were created by default with the help of the AddDefaultExtension() method. The menu will allow the user to view , add, delete ,update or search an extension . In case the user enters an extension but forgets to add a dot , the program will add it automatically . In case there is no extension , a message stating not found is displayed . I was able to apply simple OOP principles such as classes , objects , and methods and debugged all of them by dotnet run . 
  
# 3. PART II: PYTHON PROGRAMMING 
 
# 3.1  Client–Server Application 
 I created a server program based on Python Sockets, which waits to have a client . I created a client program that sends information about student admission to the server . I used SQLite to create a database file that contains all of the student data .  
Once the data is received by the server , a unique application number is created and stored  . The server sends the application number to the client . The client is sent back the application number by the server. The client shows the application number to the user . This work makes use of databases, 
TCP communication and basic string manipulation.      
 
# 3.2  Web Scraping and CSV Handling 
 I created two sample Hotel Webpages (hotelA.html and hotelB.html ) containing the names of rooms and prices since scraping of actual hotel websites is not possible . Then I wrote Python program which scraped these two pages with BeautifulSoup and collected the room data which was then stored in a CSV file and finally read the CSV file to display the results . This also enabled me to show safe and legal web scraping . 
 
# 4. CONCLUSION 
I was able to practice C# and Python by creating basic applications for this assignment. I learned how to   use OOP , data management , database administration , and client-server communication.
